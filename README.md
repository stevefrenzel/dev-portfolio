# Steve Frenzel - Web developer & accessibility engineer

## 1. A few words

I have been working on my portfolio website in some form since I started my career as a Frontend Developer in February 2019. I can't remember how many variations I created, only to discard them.

I always liked the components based approach of frameworks like [React](https://react.dev/) and [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), but had a big problem with the unnecessary client-side JavaScript generated there. I wish I could build websites like I do with these technologies, but generate static HTML websites in the process. All the more I was happy when I discovered [Astro](https://astro.build/)! It is the best of both worlds and in combination with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) it is a developer experience that leaves nothing to be desired.

## 2. Things to come
