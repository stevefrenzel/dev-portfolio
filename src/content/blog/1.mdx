Accessibility is a crucial aspect of web design, ensuring that everyone can access and use your website. However, it is often overlooked or considered secondary to other design elements. Wether you're just getting started with this topic or want to dive deeper, the [accessibility tutorial on MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility) is a great resource!

Many accessibility issues are low-hanging fruits and easy to fix with a bit of effort and attention. Also accessibility and SEO (search engine optimization) go hand in hand. So the more accessible your website, the higher are the chances for a great ranking on search engines. The first five images are screenshots from the [Inaccessible Gallery](https://inaccessible.gallery/) by [Manuel Matuzovic](https://www.matuzo.at/).

## 1. Low Contrast Text

</a>

The problem: Low contrast text is when there is not enough contrast between the text and the background, making it difficult to read for people with visual impairments.

The solution: Increase the contrast by using darker / lighter text or background color. There are two great tools out there for checking the color contrast ratio:

- [Contrast Checker by WebAIM](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/)
- [Colour Contrast Analyser by TPGi](https://www.tpgi.com/color-contrast-checker/)

## 2. Missing Alternative Text

    <Image alt="Example from Inaccessible Gallery showcasing missing alternative text" src={exhibitTwo}/>
</a>

The problem: Alternative text, or alt text, is a description of an image that is read by screen readers for people with visual impairments. When it's missing or not descriptive enough, people will have no clue what it's about or for.

The solution: When using a CMS, look for an option called "alternative text" or "alt text" when uploading your image. When coding, add it to the image element via alt="Your image description". If it's purely decorative, just add alt="" and you're good to go!

## 3. Empty Links

    <Image alt="Example from Inaccessible Gallery showcasing empty links" src={exhibitThree}/>
</a>

The problem: Empty links are links that contain no text, only an image or icon. This is a common issue for social media icons or download links.

The solution: Add descriptive text to the link that describes the action or destination of it. This will help screen readers understand the purpose of the link.

## 4. Missing Form Labels

<a href={exhibitFour.src}>
    <Image alt="Example from Inaccessible Gallery showcasing missing form labes" src={exhibitFour}/>
</a>

The problem: Forms that are missing labels make it difficult for users to understand what information is required. Often instead of labels, placeholders are being used to convey meaning. This is not sufficient, because once you start typing, the placeholder will be gone.

The solution: Add descriptive labels to form fields. This helps screen readers provide a more meaningful experience to visually impaired users, as well as people with no impairment. More information about the [label element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/label) can be found on MDN.

## 5. Empty Buttons

<a href={exhibitFive.src}>
    <Image alt="Example from Inaccessible Gallery showcasing empty buttons" src={exhibitFive}/>
</a>

The problem: Empty buttons are buttons that contain no text, only an image or color. This is pretty much the same problem as with empty links.

The solution: Add descriptive text to the [button element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/button) to determine the action of it. This will help everyone to understand what the button is for. Do not use only an image or color to convey meaning. If you cannot (for whatever reason) add text to the button, use the [aria-label](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-label) to add it. This will at least make it possible for screen reader users to understand what it's for.

## 6. Missing Document Language

    <Image alt="Collection of flower illustrations saying goodbye in different languages" src={flowers}/>
</a>

The problem: Missing document language can be a common issue, but it is easy to fix.

The solution: Simply add the [language attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/lang) to the HTML tag of your website. This helps screen readers provide a more meaningful experience to visually impaired users who use screen readers in a specific language. If there are sections (for example a quote) that have a different language than the rest of the site, add the lang attribute here and adjust it accordingly.

## Conclusion

By addressing these six common accessibility issues, you can make your website more inclusive and accessible to everyone. The best part is, that all of these issues are low-hanging fruits and can be fixed with a bit of effort and attention.
