I predict that Overlay vendors will make a lot of money with their false promise of adding a widget (with AI) to solve all accessibility problems.

Once the first lawsuit comes in because they do not work and worsen the accessibility of a website, users will start suing website owners. In return web site owners aka companies will start suing overlay vendors because they got sued (who couldâ€™ve known).

Then comes the part where they hire professionals to ACTUALLY fix their problems.
