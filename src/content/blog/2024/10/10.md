## Prologue

It must have been about two years ago that I started noticing the topic of web accessibility. Before that, I visited a [coding bootcamp](https://www.spiced-academy.com/) and started my first job and shortly after my second one, being way too busy trying to "deliver" and become more familiar with React and Next.js.

But with experience (and diminishing imposter syndrome) came the realisation that almost all of my work didn't have a good foundation. I didn't pay attention to color contrasts, keyboard or screen reader support and simply implemented what was suggested on Stack Overflow, various YouTube tutorials or by my colleagues.

## The day things changed

When I discovered that there is an official recommendation on how to build usable and robust websites, my mind was blown! It's called the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/), or ‚ú® WCAG ‚ú® for short. These standards provide guidance on how to create websites that can be used by as many people as possible. Turns out that I like standards. I am deeply involved in this topic, but I think that my knowledge can be much more profound. My craft as a web developer is not yet at the level of quality I would like it to be.

That's why I've decided to study for the [IAAP](https://www.iaap-hq.org/) WAS certificate, short for [Web Accessibility Specialist](https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/s/wascertification). However, at this point I don't actually plan to take the exam, as I'm not sure if it's really going to be of any value for my professional career. So far nobody cared about any of the certificates I've gathered, but rather if I'm a good fit as a person and if I had the necessary skills for the job. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## Parallels to music production

I am no stranger to implementing standards, as I am familiar with them as a sound engineer and music producer. In radio and cinema, for example, there are volume specifications that you have to comply to, otherwise the delivered product will not be accepted.

This is a little more relaxed in the streaming and physical media sector, but here too there are recommendations regarding average volume and what needs to be taken into account when creating masters for a vinyl production, for example.

## How I will learn

My plan is to first gather my thoughts in [FigJam](https://www.figma.com/figjam/) and organize them once I call it a (learning) day. After that I'll write or draw it very nicely into a notebook with my (inferior) drawing skills. Then I'll write an article about it and propably add some FigJam screenshots. With this approach I'm certain that some of it will stay in long-term memory. ü§û

When creating my workshops, it helped me a lot that I could stick notes in books. I'm not a fan of writing in an actual book or even dog-earing it, no way Jos√©! But nothing beats being able to look something up with your own hands. Also I haven't physically written anything in years, so this will be a nice way to introduce hand cramps into my learning routine.

## Research for the exam

To make sure it's really worth it to invest my time into this, I read a couple of articles by people who went through the same process. Some of them are quite critical, which is nice cause not everything in life is cupcakes and rainbows.

I decided to take the [Web Accessibility course by Deque University](https://dequeuniversity.com/online-courses/web-accessibility), as I'm not only a heavy user of their browser extension [axe DevTools¬Æ](https://www.deque.com/axe/devtools/) but also because they have a decent reputation in the "scene". Along with it, I will also use the [Body of Knowledge](https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/resource/WAS_Certification_FInal_2020_FINAL) provided by the IAAP for my studies. And here's the list from my research:

- [Prepare for the CPACC (or any) Exam ‚Äî Strategies for Learning Success by Jen Blatz](https://medium.com/@jnblatz/prepare-for-the-cpacc-exam-strategies-for-learning-success-97b7dc963c2a)
- [A Comprehensive Guide to Preparing for the IAAP CPACC Exam by Dongyeon Seo](https://medium.com/@dseo1212/a-comprehensive-guide-to-preparing-for-the-iaap-cpacc-exam-insights-and-strategies-30a9b22f4332)

- [CPACC Reflection by Cam Coulter](https://www.camcoulter.com/2021/07/21/cpacc-reflection/)

Yes, this is about a different exam but contents are somewhat similar, so this worked for me to understand what studying for the exam was like.

## Predictions

Looking at the body of knowledge overview, plenty of the things listed I have already done on the job to a certain extent. But I don't want to get cocky and tackle my studies with a humble attitude, as I'm very certain that I have only surface level knowledge of most of the topics. Let's see how it goes, it's gonna be fun!
