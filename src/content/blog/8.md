When I made this list, I thought it would be much longer. It feels like I've read more, but these are the books I can remember from last year. In 2022 it was a lot of non-fiction, so I'm getting a bigger kick out of reading novels and biographies. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## "Born a Crime: Stories from a South African Childhood" by Trevor Noah

I was only peripherally aware of Trevor as just another late night host, but always found him likeable. When I saw that he had written a book about his teenage years in Africa, my interest was piqued!

It's super exciting and very funny to read about how much shit he got up to with his friends, what his relationship with his mother and her partners was like and how much his buddy Hitler loved to dance. üòÖ

## "Tomorrow, and Tomorrow, and Tomorrow" by Gabrielle Zevin

Of all these books, this one is my favorite because it struck a chord with me. It's about two friends who found each other mainly through their passion for video games in the late 90s. They are both programmers and decide to program a game together. üëæ

The game becomes a hit, but the tensions between the two grow and so the plot develops. It's not a romantic love story, but it's definitely a love story. My generation especially will really enjoy it because there are tons of video game references in this book.

## "The Lincoln Highway" by Amor Towles

I tried to start with his big hit "A Gentleman in Moscow" but just couldn't get into the book. But this story was really fun because it's set in the USA in the 1950s, which is a time period often chosen by Stephen King. And I love Stephen King! üëë

What I like about the plot is that an expectation is created from the beginning, but in the end it is not satisfied at all. That's what makes this book so great, because I was on a journey with the protagonists that never really happened.

## "Normal People" by Sally Rooney

Another book that I had difficulties getting started with because I found the writing style very cumbersome. Especially the fact that dialogs were not written with quotation marks took a lot out of me.

Nevertheless, it is a very good, but also depressing book, as the two main characters not only talk past each other all the time, but also often treat each other very badly. If you're in the mood for a teenage angst book, this is the one for you. üòµ‚Äçüí´

## "Storyteller" by Dave Grohl

If you know and like Nirvana and / or Foo Fighters, you probably heard about this book or read it already.

Dave is a great storyteller and especially the chapters right before the Nirvana boom were particularly interesting to me. Also that he made no money during that time for a long time still amazes me. Gotta love the music industry! üé∂

## "The Power" by Naomi Alderman

This book is so rad! Women develop a power to shoot electrical jolts from their fingers (but can also heal) and become the dominant sex. It is very well written and the plot happens all around the world.

I really enjoyed the overall vibe and that it was easy to imagine how everything is taking place and that the exciting parts were truly exciting. üçø
