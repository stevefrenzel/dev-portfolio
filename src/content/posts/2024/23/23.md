I usually only associate a few albums with a particular year, even if there were many more that touched and moved me.

This post is primarily a reminder to myself why I put certain records on this list. But also, of course, to share them with you, dear reader. Maybe one or two are on your own list, or maybe you don't know them all but are interested in giving them a listen.

It's a good mix of genres, maybe there's something on there? The first quarter has started very well for me musically, let's see what ended up in my favorites:

## "How To Disappear" by Casey

![An open, white fence with a tree behind it growing plenty of red roses. The photo is grainy and has a warm color, giving it a nostalgic vibe. This scenery is within a thick, red frame with plenty of information below it. Like the track list, artist and album name, as well as production credits.  ](./1-casey.jpeg)

My first contact with Casey was when I had my training at coding bootcamp. [Love Is Not Enough](https://tidal.com/browse/album/314881390?u) was on my radar at the time because it hit that sweet spot between emo and hardcore that I grew to love.

After I got more involved with the band (and their second album [Where I Go When I Am Sleeping](https://tidal.com/browse/album/314869863?u)), I was very sad when I found out that they had broken up.

So I was all the more delighted when [Puncture Wounds to Heaven](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yh16Bqw2uGA) was the first sign of life after five years. There was no doubt in my mind that it would end up at the top of my Top Albums of 2024 without having heard the rest of the record.

Each subsequent single I soaked up like a sponge and confirmed my prediction even more. I love Casey, especially this record! üòç

## "Obsidian Wreath" by Infant Island

![A scenery created with water colors. In the night sky, you can see the stars in different colors and shapes. Below them are mountain tops, with no snow on them. In the center and foreground is a huge bonfire with long, wild grass around it. Directly around the fire you can see the soil, with silhouettes of people imprinted on it.](./2-infant-island.jpeg)

This is one of those records that caught my interest with its artwork. I didn't know what to expect and was very pleased to hear atmospheric black metal that doesn't just blast all the way through but also slows down from time to time.

Especially the vocals, which are sometimes out of breath, hooked me; it makes their music feel very raw and authentic.

## "Wall Of Eyes" by The Smile

![Abstract painting with orange and blue as the main colors. The shapes look lik a mix of mountain and waves. Above them are plenty of open eyes, looking at the viewer. The have different sizes and colors. In the foreground is the artist and album name in black, all uppercase letters.](3-the-smile.jpeg)

When random songs were played that I might like, something by The Smile came on and I thought to myself "boy, this guy sounds a lot like Thom Yorke!". Turns out it was another one of his projects! üòÇ

If you like Radiohead but with a lot less electronic gimmicks, you should give it a listen. I'd even say it's a bit unwieldy, but the craftsmanship is world class as you'd expect.

[Listen to "Wall Of Eyes" by The Smile](https://tidal.com/browse/album/338279162?u)

## "A City in the Skies" by Ulver

![Photograph of what appears to be a mother and her child standing barefoot on a campsite with almost no trees. The mother is touching her face with the back of her hand and looks sad or worried. The child looks to the right and doesn't seem too happy either. It has a strong red filter on it, the only other colors being black and white. In the foreground in huge, all uppercase letters is the artist and album name. ](4-ulver.jpeg)

Ulver have made an incredible transition from black metal to ambient to a proper pop band. On album length I often lost interest after the ‚Äúhits‚Äù, so this EP with its three songs is just right! Also check out [Rolling Stone](https://tidal.com/browse/track/231388647?u), what a banger!

[Listen to "A City in the Skies" by Ulver](https://tidal.com/browse/album/340237152?u)

## "Effigy" by Talk Show

![A photograph of a brick wall building with three giant antennas on it. The door is open, a graffiti can be seen and red light is coming from the inside. In front of the building are multiple black trash bags. The night sky is pitch black. ](5-talk-show.jpeg)

Another record that only sparked my interest because of its artwork. I would categorize it under electronic garage pop (?) with spoken words lyrics. I don't really listen to music in this genre, so I can't make a ‚Äúfor fans of‚Äù recommendation here. Listen to it, or don't. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

[Listen to "Effigy" by Talk Show](https://tidal.com/browse/album/319710008?u)

## "Close to Home" by A Burial At Sea

![Photo collage of three girls standing on a rock in the middle of the ocean, with their backs facing to the viewer. Further in the distance are bigger rocks and in the far distance a quarter of what appears to be planet earth. Behind earth is space with a bright, shining star or planet on center left. On the top are the artist and album name in small letters but all uppercase.](6-a-burial-at-sea.jpeg)

To be honest, I thought this was a new [After The Burial](https://tidal.com/browse/artist/3540799?u) record, but oops, it's something completely different! If you're in the mood for some not-so-typical post-rock with a lot of "happy" mathcore like [Standards](https://tidal.com/browse/artist/7485276?u), then give it a listen.

[Listen to "Close to Home" by A Burial At Sea](https://tidal.com/browse/album/330869951?u)

## "Cold Waves Divide Us" by Midas Fall

![Illustration of several jelly fishes in white and orange layered on top of each other and slightly shifted, to create the impression of movement or shaking. Behind them are several squares angled 45 degrees, which makes it look like they had wings. The background is a grey-ish texture and on the right side ist the artist and album name, all uppercase and 90 degrees tilted.](7-midas-fall.jpeg)

This record is a real grower and hard to describe. Guitar music in the broadest sense with an incredible, gifted female singer, EXTREMELY thick reverb on the vocals and very good songs.

Again, my interest was piqued by the cover. I was expecting something more technical and was pleasantly surprised.

## "Eden" by Tua

![Photograph of what appears to be a man, facing the viewer, dressed in white clothes and barefoot. He has a long, white cloth on his face covering it completely, showing the wind is blowing to the left. He's holding a white and yellow motocross bike facing the viewer as well. The scenery is a desert with a few trees and bushes in the background.](8-tua.jpeg)

My German rap phase is long gone, but Tua has managed to keep my interest over the years. [Stevia](https://tidal.com/browse/album/26886042?u) is one of the best German pop albums and the self-tilted [Tua](https://tidal.com/browse/album/199604902?u) is in no way inferior, even if the rap portion was a bit too much for me. Still he's one of the best producers and songwriters in Germany!

I listened to and loved every single from "Eden" before its release. The grey, monochrome phase is behind him and it suits his music very well that there is so much color in it now.
