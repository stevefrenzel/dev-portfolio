Musically 2024 was a great year, I listened to a lot of cool stuff. Here are my favorites:

## January

[How To Disappear by Casey](https://tidal.com/browse/album/322218976?u) - Been waiting for this for a long time and it did not disappoint. Check it out if you have a soft spot for emo music.

## February

[Eden by Tua](https://tidal.com/browse/album/347112181?u) - Not into German Rap / Hip Hop anymore, but Tua always stood out to me, especially with the [Stevia](https://tidal.com/browse/album/26886042?u) record. Incredible songwriter, producer and singer!

## March

[Every Sound Has A Color In The Valley Of The Night by Night Verses](https://tidal.com/browse/album/339236923?u) - Easily one of the best instrumental records. It's not just guitar wankery, but really great songs with a punchy and crystal clear production and very low tuned guitars.

## April

[Fundamentals, Vol. V by Brothertiger](https://tidal.com/browse/album/351517316?u) - When I need to focus, I love to listen to ambient-ish music, which is why I'm a big Hammock fan! Brothertiger's Fundamentals series is another cure for that itch. Also check out [Brothertiger Plays: Tears For Fears' Songs from the Big Chair](https://tidal.com/browse/album/109180143?u).

## May

[War Of Being by TesseracT](https://tidal.com/browse/album/300597270?u) - Although a 2023 release, I gave this one another shot and I think it's one of there best. Musically very close to their first album [One](https://tidal.com/browse/album/52078575?u), which I _love_.

## June

[POST HUMAN: NeX GEn by Bring Me The Horizon](https://tidal.com/browse/album/364332768?u) - Just a great rock / metal / pop record with incredible songwriting, even without Jordan Fish. Been a fan since [Suicide Season](https://tidal.com/browse/album/1969901?u) and love how they've evolved.

## July

[Blast by The Album Leaf](https://tidal.com/browse/album/366557856?u) - Here's another one if you need to go into the tunnel and focus. A bit more engaging and gives me a [Tangled Thoughts of Leaving](https://tidal.com/browse/artist/6382860?u) vibe from time to time.

## August

[Coyote by Dylan LeBlanc](https://tidal.com/browse/album/309757560?u) - The first song was played after listening to a Charley Crockett record and I really liked it. Folk Rock with a hint of [Fleetwood Mac](https://tidal.com/browse/artist/1134?u).

## September

[All Again by Queen of Jeans](https://tidal.com/browse/album/344655048?u) - Saw them live in Montreal, Canada as support of [Turnover](https://tidal.com/browse/artist/4931797?u) and [Movements](https://tidal.com/browse/artist/6501073?u) and was blown away. Shoegaze meets Indie with awesome vocals.

## October

[with you in spirit by Balance and Composure](https://tidal.com/browse/album/361838478?u) - One of my all-time favorites and they released exactly the record I was longing for. Same vibe as [Casey](#january), but different.

## November

[AMERICAN MOTOR SPORTS by Bilmuri](https://tidal.com/browse/album/371191194?u) - This is truly an "all killers, no fillers" record with many, many melodies and riffs that will stick for days and weeks. Get in here if you wanna hear the perfect mix of Pop, Metal and Country! Saw them as support for [Sleep Token](https://tidal.com/browse/artist/8118903?u) and was blown away, 1000% energy ðŸ”¥

## December

[EXCESSIVE GUILT by thrown](https://tidal.com/browse/album/363349693?u) - Fuck, this record goes so hard in such a short amount of time. Give it a go if you're a fan of [Knocked Loose](https://tidal.com/browse/artist/6928332?u) or [Graphic Nature](https://tidal.com/browse/artist/16683683?u)!
