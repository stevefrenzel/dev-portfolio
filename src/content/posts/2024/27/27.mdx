There's no introduction for this, it's music I listened to in the past six months and now I'm sharing it with you! LET'S DO THIS üí™

## April 2024

### Charley Crockett - $10 Cowboy

<Image

  loading="eager"
/>

If you ever wanted to get into Country music (like me) but thought it was way too corny and clich√© (like me), you should give Charley Crockett a listen.

He's got lots of influences that make his music very unique, like Blues, Jazz or Motown. [He also seems to be a very nice, genuine guy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi0JyLKTbDA)

### Full Of Hell - Coagulated Bliss

<Image alt="Cover artwork for Full Of Hell - Coagulated Bliss" src={imageTwo} />

The collaboration between [Full Of Hell and Nothing](https://tidal.com/browse/album/316979894?u) is one of the best things that's ever happened to the scene, so I was very interested to hear what a "regular" album would sound like.

It's not totally up my alley, but if you're in need of some legit, heavy punk music: Go for it!

### Northlane - Mirror's Edge

<Image alt="Cover artwork for Northlane - Mirror's Edge" src={imageThree} />

Northlane is one of THE bands in the [Djent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Djent) genre, but I never really got into them. I still got curious when I saw that they released an EP, which is usually easier to digest, especially in this genre.

When I saw that they had a song with Ian from [Karnivool](https://tidal.com/browse/artist/19239?u), I was sold. A match made in heaven. üòá

## May 2024

### Bring Me The Horizon - POST HUMAN: NeX GEn

<Image
  alt="Cover artwork for Bring Me The Horizon - POST HUMAN: NeX GEn"
  src={imageFour}
/>

Hearing that [Jordan Fish was no longer part of the band](https://loudwire.com/bring-me-the-horizon-oli-sykes-exact-reason-split-jordan-fish/) made me a bit concerned, as he seemed to have a big influence on their sound for the last decade.

After a couple of listens this record REALLY clicked with me though and it might be favourite album. There's the heavy, there's the soft, there's the in-between and it all sounds like BMTH.

### Knocked Loose - You Won't Go Before You're Supposed To

<Image

I saw them last year and was super impressed, they really know how to work a crowd as soon as they enter the stage. If you're a fan of super heavy, groovy music with an ear for details, give them a listen.

If you're interested in how the title came about, check out [The Downbeat episode with singer Bryan Garris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b7MWE9Z0mOM).

## June 2024

### Washed Out - Notes from a Quiet Life

<Image
  alt="Cover artwork for Washed Out - Notes from a Quiet Life"
  src={imageSix}
/>

One of my favourite and most played albums ever is [Purple Noon](https://tidal.com/browse/album/147965124?u), so I had really high expectations for this one. The first single "The Hardest Part" was the perfect cure for that itch, even though it was less melancholic than before and I hate this generative "AI" video.

The record as a whole was disappointing for me, as it's just too much on the happy side, at least musically. What can I say, I'm a sad emo boy ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### Queen of Jeans - All Again

<Image alt="Cover artwork for Queen of Jeans - All Again" src={imageSeven} />

I only discovered this record after seeing them live in September in Montreal (Canada) supporting [Movements](https://tidal.com/browse/artist/6501073?u) and [Turnover](https://tidal.com/browse/artist/4931797?u).

Instantly fell in love with them, especially with their singer's voice! üòç For fans of shoe-gaze dream pop with stunning vocals and great hooks.

## July 2024

### Charley Crockett - Visions of Dallas

<Image

The output of this man is incredible, two albums in one year! I can't put my finger down why, but I like this one more than $10 Cowboy.

### Cigarettes After Sex - X's

<Image alt="Cover artwork for Cigarettes After Sex - X's" src={imageNine} />

Having a moody day and just want to snuggle up while there's a slight drizzle outside? Or just need to come down after a stressful day? Then this record will be the perfect soundtrack for you!

### Graphic Nature - Who Are You When No One Is Watching?

<Image
  alt="Cover artwork for Graphic Nature - Who Are You When No One Is Watching?"
  src={imageTen}
/>

Ever since the first record came out I'm a massive fan! I like to refer to them as "Slipknot but cool", as they're giving me strong [Iowa](https://tidal.com/browse/album/68572327?u)-era vibes. Music and lyrics go hard, enjoy the ride!

### The Album Leaf - Blast

<Image alt="Cover artwork for The Album Leaf - Blast" src={imageEleven} />

I've known the name for a while, but never checked them out. This has become my go-to focus music now, as it has just the right amount of percussion while still being ambient.

The whole record has a great climax, the cover artwork captures it perfectly. Can't believe that this is a live session! üò±

## August 2024

### Holding Absence - The Noble Art Of Self Destruction

<Image
  alt="Cover artwork for Holding Absence - The Noble Art Of Self Destruction"
  src={imageTwelve}
/>

Ok, so this record came out in 2023, but I only discovered it because [Lucas and Ash were guests in The Downbeat Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoeMirzkFMU). They seemed super nice, so I checked out there music and got hooked instantly!

Creative songwriting and singing, as well as one of the best song transitions ever from "False Dawn" to "Scissors". For people who listen to Metal but actually like Pop music.

### Lambert - Actually Good

<Image alt="Cover artwork for Lambert - Actually Good" src={imageThirteen} />

Not as experimental as his [True](https://tidal.com/browse/album/117224660?u) and [False](https://tidal.com/browse/album/170554588?u) album, but a more "typical" Lambert making calm, relaxing piano music while being technically impressive at the same time. This record is actually good!

## September 2024

### Foxing - Foxing

<Image alt="Cover artwork Foxing" src={imageFourteen} />

This band hit the nerve so much, I can't believe I haven't listened to it more. It's like a melancholic Pink Floyd with its fair share of (Black) Metal. Sounds wild and really good!

<SafeYouTubeEmbed id="ULtsv_-dscM" title="Foxing - Greyhound" />

### thrown - EXCESSIVE GUILT

<Image alt="Cover artwork for thrown - EXCESSIVE GUILT" src={imageFifteen} />

This band goes so hard and needs only a little more than 20 minutes to show you how it's done. The sound is ignorantly fat and loud, songs are short and straight to the point. Perfect for working out or any other occasion where you need to pump the gas a little bit.
