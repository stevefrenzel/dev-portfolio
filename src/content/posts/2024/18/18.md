Once again I [summoned the swarm intelligence of Mastodon](https://mastodon.online/@stvfrnzl/112076174840502681) so I need to do less research for a blog article of mine. Conferences are not only a great way to get out of the office, it's also an opportunity to get in touch with "the scene". Newsletters and RSS feeds can only do so much and it's a lot more inspiring to listen to (and watch) people from the community about topics that are important to them and relevant.

I’ve only been to a ginormous one (WeAreDevelopers World Congress) and a cozy small-ish one (SmashingConf Belgium), so I can’t compare that much, but my experience so far has been great.

Traveling is fun and what could be better than a paid trip by your employer to explore new cities, meet like-minded people and nerd out about web dev and design related things? Bonus for your employer: You come back with fresh ideas! ✨

Which is why I created this list for you (and me), so you can suggest it to your colleagues and bosses. Please let me know if you want me to add a conference, I consider this article a living thing. See you there!
