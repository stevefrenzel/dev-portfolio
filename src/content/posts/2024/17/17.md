Today is international women's fight day and I want to celebrate all the women who help me get through the day with their music, lift my spirits or simply put me in a certain mood.

No matter if you're into metal, pop, hardcore, punk or something in-between: I bet there's at least on record in this list of female-fronted and man-reared albums that you're gonna like. ðŸŽ§

## "Sound & Color" by Alabama Shakes

The only interesting Grammy category for me is "Best Engineered Album", which is how I discovered this awesome band!

## "Is It Light Where You Are" by Art School Girlfriend

A friend recommended this one, which is prefect for a moody, rainy day. Or maybe Tokyo at night.

## "Only Constant" by Gel

Imagine MotÃ¶rhead with a strong Hardcore and Punk influence plus female vocals and you"ll know what to expect from this one.

## "Keepsake" by Hatchie

!["Keepsake" by Hatchie](4-music.jpeg)

Dreamy pop music with a 90s vibe. Hard to describe, but a pleasure to listen to.

## "Retrovision" by Honey Revenge

!["Retrovision" by Honey Revenge](5-music.jpeg)

This is for the old school Paramore funs: Epic hooks, fat guitars and juicy drums.

## "EVERGREEN" by PVRIS

!["Evergreen" by Paris](6-music.jpeg)

On of my favorite records ever! Every song is super catchy, the hooks are spectular and the production is stellar. My go-to album for getting the crowd pumped up before a gig (when I work as live sound engineer).

## "The Fear of Fear" by Spiritbox

![ALT_T"The Fear of Fear" by SpiritboxEXT](7-music.jpeg)

Canada's finest ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦âœ¨ If you"re a fan of modern metal, low-tuned guitars, beefy screamed vocals and great vocal melodies, then GET THE FUCK IN HERE ðŸ‘‡

## "COPINGMECHANISM" by WILLOW

!["Coping Mechanism" by Willow](8-music.jpg)

Her music is a bit diffult to describe, but I would call it super polished garage pop? The songs are well written and produced but sound raw at the same time.
