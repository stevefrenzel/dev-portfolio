I recently gave several smaller workshops on the subject of web accessibility and started with a rough overview of the topic. It was about the [general meaning](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Accessibility/What_is_accessibility#so_what_is_accessibility), the [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/), the [four principles](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/Understanding_WCAG#the_four_principles) and the [European Accessibility Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Accessibility_Act).

After this workshop, I was asked if I knew of any examples of companies being sued because of web accessibility problems. I spontaneously thought of two: Beyoncé and Domino's Pizza.

Unfortunately, I had to stop here because I couldn't give any more details. So I would like to list a few famous law suits here for future reference and show that most of the problems were trivial and among the [six most common](https://webaim.org/projects/million/#wcag) on the web. Which in most cases are very easy to fix.

All information comes from the "Digital Accessibility Lawsuits" subpage of [accessibility.com](http://accessibility.com/). More details can be found under the link for each example. Also I’m not a lawyer and cannot give you any legal advice.

### Case summary - Parkwood Entertainment LLC

On January 3, 2019, MARY CONNER filed a Complaint in New York Federal court against PARKWOOD ENTERTAINMENT LLC.

Plaintiff MARY CONNER alleges that [www.Beyonce.com](http://www.beyonce.com/) is not accessible per the WCAG 2.1, Section 508 accessibility standard(s).

### Case details - Parkwood Entertainment LLC

Case arises out of Parkwood’s policy and practice of denying the blind access to the goods and services offered by [Beyonce.com](http://beyonce.com/).

Due to Parkwood’s failure and refusal to remove access barriers to [Beyonce.com](http://beyonce.com/), blind individuals have been and are being denied equal access to Beyonce, as well as to the numerous goods, services and benefits offered to the public through [Beyonce.com](http://beyonce.com/).

### My comment

Unfortunately, there are no details here as to what exactly the problems are, but since it cites "practice of denying the blind access to the goods and services" as the reason, I suspect the following:

- Missing alt text
- Empty links
- Empty buttons
- Elements cannot be operated with screen reader

## Guillermo Robles vs. Domino’s Pizza LLC

### Case details - Domino's Pizza

This is a summarized version of mine:

- Website cannot be operated by a blind or visually-impaired person

## Conclusion

These are just a few examples from very well-known companies, but they all make more or less the same mistakes, which can be easily avoided and rectified. So what I told my workshop participants is:

If you can avoid the six most common problems, you will not only provide a good experience for your users, but you will make yourself less vulnerable to law suits. The work doesn't stop here, but you've already taken a big step in the right direction.
