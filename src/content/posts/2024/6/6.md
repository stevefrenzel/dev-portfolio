A reference book and a pair of reading glasses rests behind them. Across the table, the Black person with short hair examines a small figurine through a magnifying glass that's centered on an eye. The craft area is warmly lit by two desk lamps and the illustration background is a yellow green.

When working with people from different cultures and countries, there are a few things you can keep in mind to ensure that everyone feels equally integrated. This short list of tips is based on my own experience and is not exhaustive. However, it provides a good starting point as most things are very easy to implement:

## Table of contents

1. [Pronouns](#1-pronouns)
2. [Addressing a group of people](#2-addressing-a-group-of-people)
3. [Accessible charts](#3-accessible-charts)
4. [Providing subtitles](#4-providing-subtitles)
5. [Calling someone out](#5-calling-someone-out)
6. [Using inappropriate words or emojis](#6-using-inappropriate-words-or-emojis)

## 1. Pronouns

When talking about your customers or users, use the pronouns "they/them" instead of "he/him" or "she/her". This will include everyone, even those who identify as neither male nor female. It also applies when your colleagues tell you which is their real pronoun.

## 2. Addressing a group of people

Instead of using "guys", use "people", "everyone" or "folks" when speaking to a diverse group of people. This way everyone will feel addressed, as "guys" is a rather masculine term.

## 3. Accessible charts

When presenting charts, make sure that the content is not only conveyed through colors. You may have color-blind colleagues and they may have difficulty understanding the diagram.

Look at your diagram in black and white. Can you still easily grasp and relate all the information? If not, add shapes, additional text, or change the brightness of the colours to make them easier to distinguish.

## 4. Providing subtitles

If you share audio or video files with your colleagues, make sure that everyone can understand the content. For example, if you are giving a presentation in Spanish, you can provide subtitles in English if that is the language spoken at work.

There are now several AI-based services that offer this quickly and easily. An investment that can not only increase productivity, but also reduce frustration! Here are three suggestions:

- [FlexClip](https://www.flexclip.com/tools/auto-subtitle/)

## 5. Calling someone out

When I read [How to Learn to Code & Get a Developer Job](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-to-code-book/) by Quincy Larson, one sentence stuck with me: "Praise in public, criticise in private."
How would you feel if one of your colleagues criticised you in front of the whole team, even if it was very polite? Even if it's justified, it can be inappropriate to do it in this context. It makes them look like a bully and the other person might feel blindsided and exposed.

Instead, emphasise what the person has done well and discuss the critical things in private. This creates a safe space in which both people can concentrate on solving the problem without outside interference.

## 6. Using inappropriate words or emojis

Sometimes our counterpart may feel offended or hurt because we have used a certain word or emoji in the wrong context. If you want to get an overview of whether such words are in your everyday vocabulary, take a look at Self-Defined.

Here is a small selection of words that I often hear in my everyday life that can be replaced with less offensive alternatives:

- [Crazy](https://www.selfdefined.app/definitions/crazy/)
- [Dumb](https://www.selfdefined.app/definitions/dumb/)
- [R-word](https://www.selfdefined.app/definitions/r-word/)
