## TL;DR

Always consider the [first rule of ARIA use](https://www.w3.org/TR/using-aria/#rule1) before doing anything:

> “If you can use a native HTML element or attribute […], then do so.”

For example, Adrian Roselli's [priority of methods for labeling a control](https://adrianroselli.com/2020/01/my-priority-of-methods-for-labeling-a-control.html) are:

1. Native HTML techniques
2. `aria-labelledby` pointing at existing visible text
3. Visibly-hidden content that is still in the page
4. `aria-label`

### aria-label in short

Use `aria-label` to change the accessible name of the _current_ element.

However, as this element has "spotty accuracy of automated translation" [^1], it's best to avoid this element "at all, unless it's the only practical possibility. Using references to `hidden` elements avoids this problem, since the text they refer to is just regular element text." [^2]

When overriding the visible accessible name of an element, there's also the potential risk of a [WCAG Success Criterion 2.5.3: Label in Name](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/label-in-name.html) failure, in addition to [code smell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_smell). [^3]

### aria-labelledby in short

Use `aria-labelledby` to change the accessible name of the current element, by referencing a _different_ element, for example a heading. This text should be concise. It accepts multiple references.

### aria-describedby in short

Use `aria-describedby` to provide additional information for the current element, by referencing a descriptive text, for a example an error message. This text can be more in-depth and it also accepts multiple references.

### Hidden elements and precedence

Elements referenced by `aria-labelledby` and `aria-describedby` don't have to be visible or present in the accessibility tree at all. Simplified example:

```html
<button aria-labelledby="label" type="button">
  <span hidden id="label">Delete</span>
</button>
```

The order of precedence is:

1. `aria-labelledby`
2. `aria-label`
3. `aria-describedby`

## Why I’m writing this

When I attended a coding bootcamp in 2019, we started by going through the basics of HTML, CSS and JavaScript, then quickly moved on to JavaScript frameworks like [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) and [React](https://react.dev/). I don't remember exactly, but if anything, we only discussed the purpose of `aria-label`.

When I came across the attributes `aria-labelledby` and `aria-describedby` while researching for my first job, I was quite confused. I now work full-time at [TWIN CUBES GmbH](https://www.twin-cubes.com/) on the subject of accessibility and I often see these attributes in use, but not necessarily used correctly.

And to be 100% transparent: Sometimes I'd go for a solution that includes `aria-label`, even though there could've been a way to avoid it altogether.

As these three attributes are very similar, but still serve different purposes, I want to show practical examples of how they might be used. But always keep the first rule of ARIA use in mind:

> If you _can_ use a native HTML element or attribute with the semantics and behaviour you require **already built in**, instead of re-purposing an element and adding an ARIA role, state or property to make it accessible**, then do so**.

(I recommend checking out the other rules as well.)

## aria-label

The [W3C explanation for `aria-label`](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#aria-label) reads as follows:

> Defines a string value that labels the current element. […]
>
> It provides the user with a recognisable name of the object. […]
>
> If the label text is visible on screen, authors _SHOULD_ use `aria-labelledby` and _SHOULD NOT_ use `aria-label`.
>
> There may be instances where the name of an element cannot be determined programmatically from the content of the element, and there are cases where providing a visible label is not the desired user experience. […]

If it’s not possible to use the visible text as accessible name, or if there’s no visible text at all, it might be a use case for `aria-label`.

However, there's the issue of spotty automated translation with this attribute, which James Edwards pointed out:

> `aria-label` generally isn't picked up by auto-translation services, so it's best to avoid using it at all, unless it's the only practical possibility.
>
> Using references to `hidden` elements avoids this problem, since the text they refer to is just regular element text.

Whenever possible, you should rather provide the accessible name through the interactive HTML element itself. As [`aria-label` may override the visible accessible name](https://ericwbailey.design/published/aria-label-is-a-code-smell/#:~:text=aria%2Dlabel%20may%20override%20the%20visible%20accessible%20name), you're also at risk to fail WCAG Success Criterion 2.5.3: Label in Name, as Eric points out in his article.

I suggest to give Adrian's and Eric's articles a read, as they go further into detail. You can find them in the [TL;DR](#tldr) section.

It should dawn on you by now that it's best to avoid `aria-label` whenever you can, as it comes with plenty of drawbacks.

### Button example (change contrast)

This first example shows an icon-only button to change the color contrast providing only a decorative image as visual cue:

```html
<button aria-label="Change contrast" type="button">
  <img alt="" src="/color-contrast.svg" />
</button>
```

Depending on the context, the meaning of this element might be obvious for sighted people. For users of assistive technology, we add the `aria-label` attribute to the `<button>` element. This way it should be announced as “button, change contrast” or similar.

BUT: Following the first rule of ARIA use, we should provide this text through the `alt` attribute of the `<img>` element instead of the `aria-label` attribute on the `<button>` element.

```html
<button type="button">
  <img alt="Change contrast" src="/color-contrast.svg" />
</button>
```

### Link example

While the following link text is sufficient, we want to communicate to assistive technology that this leads away from the current website. Therefore we’re overwriting the current text and enhance it with additional information:

```html
<a aria-label="Wikipedia (external link)" href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">
  Wikipedia
  <img alt="" src="/external-link.svg" />
</a>
```

We’ve provided a visual cue with an icon after the link text and a programmatically determinable one using the `aria-label` attribute. No matter the visual name, the accessible name will be “Wikipedia (external link)”.

As James Edwards pointed out, the ARIA-free alternative could be to use the `alt` attribute of the image to add "(external link)" to the accessible name:

```html
<a href="https://www.wikipedia.org/">
  Wikipedia
  <img alt="(external link)" src="/external-link.svg" />
</a>
```

## aria-labelledby

Here’s what the [W3C says about `aria-labelledby`](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#aria-labelledby):

> Identifies the element (or elements) that labels the current element. […]
>
> The purpose of `aria-labelledby` is the same as that of `aria-label`. It provides the user with a recognisable name of the object. […]
>
> As required by the text alternative computation, user agents give precedence to `aria-labelledby` over `aria-label` when computing the accessible name property. […]

The `aria-labelledby` attribute is similar to `aria-describedby` in that both reference other elements to calculate a text alternative, but a label should be concise, where a description is intended to provide more verbose information.

>

They say that `aria-labelledby` is preferred when `aria-label` is also present, because it can reference an already existing (visible) name.

They also mention the purpose of it: Keep it short with `aria-labelledby`, go into detail with `aria-describedby`.

### List example

Let’s say we have a bunch of links for cities in our footer, ordered by country. We can associate every list with the general and the individual heading by referencing the `id` attribute using `aria-labelledby`:

```html
<h2 id="locations">Locations</h2>

<h3 id="germany">Germany</h3>

<ul aria-labelledby="locations germany">
  <li>
    <a href="/berlin">Berlin</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="/hamburg">Hamburg</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="/munich">Munich</a>
  </li>
</ul>
```

This way, users of assistive technology should be able to quickly understand the relationship when traversing only the lists on a page.

It’s also possible to reference multiple elements with `aria-labelledby`! This example could be announced as “list, 3 items, Locations Germany”.

### Section example

To understand the overall structure of a website better, users of assistive technology can navigate quickly via [landmark elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/blog/aria-accessibility-html-landmark-roles/). On of them being the `<section>` element, which will be announced once `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` are present:

```html
<section aria-labelledby="heading-cupcakes">
  <h2 id="heading-cupcakes">I love cupcakes</h2>
  <p>Cupcake ipsum dolor sit amet cotton candy muffin shortbread toffee.</p>
</section>
```

This could be announced as “region, I love cupcakes”. If multiple regions are present (and correctly labeled), this could help them to understand the document outline better.

But be careful to use landmark elements moderately, otherwise this could create too much “noise” and might be overwhelming for certain people.

## aria-describedby

The [W3C says the following about `aria-describedby`](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#aria-describedby):

> Identifies the element (or elements) that describes the object. See related `aria-labelledby`.
>
> The `aria-labelledby` attribute is similar to the `aria-describedby` in that both reference other elements to calculate a text alternative, but a label should be concise, where a description is intended to provide more verbose information.
>
> The element or elements referenced by the `aria-describedby` comprise the entire description.
>
> Include ID references to multiple elements if necessary, or enclose a set of elements (e.g., paragraphs) with the element referenced by the ID.

As mentioned earlier, we use `aria-describedby` to go into detail by referencing a larger amount of text.

### Error message example

A perfect use case would be to connect a form input with the respective error message.

```html
<label for="email">Enter your e-mail:</label>

<input
  aria-describedby="error-message"
  aria-invalid="true"
  autocomplete="email"
  id="email"
  required
  type="email"
/>

<p id="error-message">
  Please enter a valid e-mail address. Example: jane@doe.com
</p>
```

We’re not only referencing the error message, but also providing a clue that this input field is invalid using the `aria-invalid` attribute.

When selecting the input element using assistive technology, it could be announced as “Enter your e-mail: Please enter a valid e-mail address. Example: <jane@doe.com>, required invalid text, edit text email field”.

### Button example (delete)

Assume we have a user interface where we can delete stuff by clicking a button. But because of limited real estate, we can only use the text “Delete” to describe it’s purpose.

To give some more context for users of assistive technology, we could provide a description using the [`hidden`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Global_attributes/hidden) attribute:

```html
<button aria-describedby="description" type="button">Delete</button>

<span hidden id="description">
  Removes all items in the trash bin immediately
</span>
```

This could be announced as “Delete Removes all items in the trash bin immediately, button”

## Precedence

Let’s stick with the delete button example to showcase how precedence works with these three attributes.

_This is an example for showcase purposes only, please DO NOT use it in production!_

We’re gonna add a heading, which we’ll reference using `aria-labelledby` and overwrite the button text using `aria-label`.

What do you think will be announced to assistive technology when selecting the button?

```html
<h2 id="heading">Trash bin</h2>

<button
  aria-describedby="description"
  aria-label="Delete all content"
  aria-labelledby="heading"
  type="button"
>
  Delete
</button>

<p class="visually-hidden" id="description">
  Removes all items in the trash bin immediately.
</p>
```

It’s “Trash bin”!

`aria-labelledby` takes preference when the other two are present. When removing it, the accessible name would be “Delete all content”, which is provided by `aria-label`, so `aria-describedby` is last in line.
